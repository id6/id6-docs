This authentication startegy lets your users register and sign in using an email and password. It features everything from registration to password reset.

```dotenv
ID6_LOCAL_AUTH_ENABLED="true"
```

By default, emails are printed to the console, but you might want a proper [email configuration](/configuration/emails).
